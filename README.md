## Weather Dashboard
  
## Description
Weather Dashboard is an application that allows users to search any cities around the world of users' choice and get current weather information
and future forecasts for 5 days. Whether users are planning a trip to a close region or far region, it is essential for travelers to have 
access to weather information, so travelers can prepare their trip accordingly. The application not only provides temperature of the chosen city but
also provides city's wind condition and humidity. Furthermore, the application stores user's search history, so a user can quickly re-access the city
if he/she wants to check the current weather again. 

## Usage
The application provides a simple and convenient way for users to check current weather condition before making a trip. 
Also, the application reflects real time weather condition of a chosen city, so it provides time sensitive information to users.
